# Thyroid-Nodule-Malignancy-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This Jupyter Notebook applies three machine learning models to predict thyroid nodule malignancy: Random Forest for ensemble-based classification, K-Means for unsupervised pattern discovery, and a Neural Network for nonlinear feature learning, trained on diagnostic data to evaluate accuracy and feature importance.
